# ising-potts-montecarlo-materials-science

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of Monte Carlo simulations for the two-dimensional (2D) Ising and Potts models, based on exercises from Introduction to Computational Materials Science by Richard LeSar (Ch. 7 & 10). The codes were developed to explore key concepts in statistical mechanics and computational materials science.

## Overview

The primary focus of this project is the numerical simulation of phase transitions and critical phenomena using the Monte Carlo method. Both the 2D Ising and Potts models are implemented using the Metropolis algorithm, enabling the study of temperature-dependent behavior in lattice-based spin systems.

## Source of Exercises

The exercises implemented in this project are derived from:

    Chapter 7 – Monte Carlo Simulations of the Ising Model

    Chapter 10 – Extensions to the Potts Model

In addition to the exercises, some guide codes provided in the book were referenced and built upon during the development of these MATLAB scripts.

## Contents

This repository includes the following files:

    MCIsing.m – MATLAB code for the Ising model

    MCPotts.m – MATLAB code for the Potts model

    DOCUMENT.pdf – A comprehensive report that includes:

        Explanation of the models and simulation approach

        Simulation parameters and implementation details

        Graphical results and discussions

        Reflections on system behavior under varying conditions

## Documentation

The accompanying report (DOCUMENT.pdf) provides a detailed summary of the implementation and findings. It is intended to guide readers through the theoretical background, code structure, and interpretation of results.
